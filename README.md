#Background
CTCH 312 Class Project

Fire Boy and Water Girl is a well known game where two characters collaborate to obtain a key and unlock the exit door to complete each level. Our proposed game will be similar except the two characters will be a cat and a dog. Each pet has its unique strengths and weaknesses, creating an engaging gameplay experience. The motivation behind our game is to provide both entertainment and education, particularly targeting children interested in learning about pets and teamwork.

Players control both the cat and the dog using the same keyboard, enabling solo play or multiplayer cooperation. The cat possesses nimble abilities, including jumping over obstacles and scaling walls, while the dog is able to swim and bark to scare away enemies. To progress through levels, players must strategically utilize each pet's abilities, collaborating to overcome challenges and collect treats or keys to advance.
	
Our game features levels that progressively increase in difficulty. Players will encounter various obstacles requiring utilization of the cat and dog's different abilities to navigate through each stage. The diverse challenges ensure an engaging and dynamic gameplay experience.

As a platformer game, our project draws inspiration from games like Super Mario and Terraria, while introducing unique mechanics centered around pet interaction and teamwork. By combining the elements of platformer gameplay with the dynamics of pet companionship, we aim to deliver an immersive and enjoyable gaming experience for players of all ages with the aim to educate them about the unique ability of our pets and how despite being so different, it is what teamwork that allows us to achieve great things.
