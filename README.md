Frinci and Rosie is a game in the cooperative platformer genre. The platformer genre is a game genre where characters jump from one platform to another encountering objects, obstacles and enemies until they reach the objective of the level. The cooperative aspect stems from the requirement of two characters (usually two players) having to work together to solve a level and reach the objective. The larger genre of this game is action, which is usually a fast-paced game where one must complete an objective after passing through some enemies or obstructions. Frinci and Rosie are platformers because the pets must jump from one platform to the next to defeat enemies like vacuums and robots and must navigate obstacles like heights and water pools to get to the end.

The motivations for this game were a few different factors. It is designed as a casual game geared towards people who have pets or children. Our motivation is the fact that one of us has a cat and the other a dog and we wanted to create a game involving them. We took inspiration from Watergirl and Fireboy, a two-character platformer. The game is meant to convey the message that two animals often depicted as enemies can work together toward a common goal. In this case, the goal is for them to get their treats back, but only one pet canâ€™t navigate the boxes of the storage room. The motivation is to teach anyone but specifically children about the benefits of teamwork and cooperation in accomplishing their goals.
